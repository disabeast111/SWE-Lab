# Team Contract

(Answer each of the following questions. Add anything you want at the bottom of
the section.)

**Is it acceptable for one or two team members to do more work than the others
in order to get the team an A?**

Answer: For the most part no, we should try and keep the load as equal as possible.

**How will you use the in-class time?**

Answer: We will spend most of our in-class time figuring out where everyone is at and planning how to do the rest of our tasks. We will talk about any issues we are having to see if other members have any insight. We will also discuss when to schedule out of class meetings.

**How often will you meet outside of class?**

Answer: We will meet at least twice out of class, either in person or over a call on Discord.

**How will work be divided among team members?**

Answer: First we will separate the work load into at least four pieces or more. We will then rate each with a difficulty score between 1-5. Depending on the amount of pieces we initially divided up, we will then give each member approximately the same amount of difficulty score.

(Besides coding, tasks include printing the code and the sheets, etc.)

**What will you do if one or more team members are not doing their share of the work?**

Answer: We will focus on communication. We understand that there can be issues and problems that may present themselves in the code that may cause someone to miss a deadline. As long as there is communication prior to a meeting and deadline the team can adapt and accept changes. We can adapt tasks if a member is struggling to receive help from another. If however, deadlines are not being met with little to no communication, the group will make a majority vote on if a partial grade is necessary. 

(Such decisions must be reported to the instructor in written form. The member
receiving the penalty may switch to another team at the instructor's discretion
after the certain lab is finished.)


**How will you track who is responsible for which tasks and the work progress?**

Answer: We will use a Google Doc to track tasks, progress, and deadlines. We will also include the in-class meetings and the out of class ones.
